# Product Context: Crop Stress Detection

## Why this project exists

The project addresses the critical need for early and accurate detection of crop stress in agriculture. Crop stress, caused by factors like nutrient deficiencies and drought, can significantly reduce crop yield and quality, leading to substantial economic losses for farmers. Traditional methods of detection are often manual, time-consuming, and require expert knowledge, making them inefficient for large-scale farming.

## Problems it solves

*   **Early Detection:** Identifies stress conditions before they become severe, allowing for timely intervention.
*   **Efficiency:** Automates the detection process, reducing the need for manual inspection across vast agricultural lands.
*   **Accuracy:** Provides a data-driven approach to identify specific types of stress (nutrient deficiency, drought) with higher precision.
*   **Resource Optimization:** Helps farmers optimize resource allocation (water, fertilizers) by targeting affected areas, reducing waste and environmental impact.
*   **Yield Improvement:** Contributes to healthier crops and improved yields by enabling proactive management of plant health.

## How it should work

The system should take images of crops as input, process them, and then classify the images to determine if the crops are healthy, suffering from nutrient deficiency, or experiencing drought stress. The output should clearly indicate the detected stress type.

## User experience goals

*   **Simplicity:** The process of using the model for prediction should be straightforward, requiring minimal technical expertise from the end-user (e.g., a farmer or agricultural technician).
*   **Reliability:** The model should provide consistent and accurate predictions, building trust with users.
*   **Actionability:** The detection results should be clear and actionable, enabling users to make informed decisions regarding crop management.
*   **Accessibility:** While a GUI is out of scope for this project, the command-line interface should be well-documented and easy to use.

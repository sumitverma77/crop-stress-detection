# Technical Context: Crop Stress Detection Project

## Technologies Used

*   **Python 3.8+:** The primary programming language for the entire project.
*   **TensorFlow 2.19.0:** The deep learning framework used for building, training, and evaluating the CNN models.
*   **Keras (part of TensorFlow):** High-level API for building and training deep learning models, simplifying the development process.
*   **NumPy:** Essential library for numerical operations, especially for handling arrays and matrices in data processing.
*   **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly if structured data (like CSV files for labels) is involved.
*   **Scikit-learn:** Utilized for machine learning utilities, potentially for data splitting, metrics, or other general ML tasks.
*   **Matplotlib:** For creating visualizations, such as training/validation loss and accuracy plots.
*   **OpenCV-Python (`cv2`):** Library for computer vision tasks, potentially used for image loading, resizing, and other image manipulations.
*   **Pillow (PIL Fork):** Another widely used library for image processing, often used in conjunction with deep learning frameworks for image loading and transformations.

## Development Setup

*   **Operating System:** Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
*   **Virtual Environment (`venv`):** Recommended for managing project-specific dependencies. This ensures that the project's libraries do not conflict with other Python projects on the system.
    *   Creation: `python -m venv venv`
    *   Activation (Windows): `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
    *   Activation (macOS/Linux): `source venv/bin/activate`
*   **Package Installation:** Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` and installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
*   **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a suitable IDE, offering good Python support, terminal integration, and virtual environment management.

## Technical Constraints

*   **Image Data Format:** The model expects image data in a format compatible with TensorFlow's image processing utilities (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
*   **Model Size:** The size of the trained model (`.h5` file) should be manageable for submission. Large models might require compression or specific instructions for download.
*   **Computational Resources:** Training deep learning models can be computationally intensive, requiring a GPU for efficient training, especially with larger datasets or more complex architectures.
*   **Python Version Compatibility:** The specified `tensorflow==2.19.0` requires a compatible Python version (typically Python 3.8-3.11).

# Active Context: Crop Stress Detection Project

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus is to prepare the `22BCE10679_SumitVerma_CropStressDetection` project for final submission. This involves:
1.  Verifying that the project structure adheres to the specified requirements.
2.  Ensuring all submission checklist items are met (code runs, model performance, complete documentation).
3.  Creating a comprehensive memory bank to document the project for future reference.

## Recent Changes

*   **Memory Bank Initialization:** Started creating the core memory bank files within `docs/memory-bank/`.
    *   `projectbrief.md` has been created.
    *   `productContext.md` has been created.

## Next Steps

1.  **Continue Memory Bank Creation:**
    *   Create `activeContext.md` (this file).
    *   Create `systemPatterns.md`.
    *   Create `techContext.md`.
    *   Create `progress.md`.
2.  **Guide User on Terminal Actions:** Advise the user to perform the necessary steps in the terminal to verify code functionality (install dependencies, train model, make predictions).
3.  **Verify Submission Checklist:** Work with the user to confirm all submission requirements are met, including data presence, model saving, and report generation.
4.  **Finalize Documentation:** Ensure the main `README.md` and other documentation are complete and accurate.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

*   The `README.md` in `docs/` is already quite detailed and will serve as the primary user-facing documentation. The memory bank will provide internal, more structured documentation.
*   The mAP requirement for the model has been clarified to mean accuracy > 80% for this classification task.
*   The user needs to manually ensure the `report.pdf` and actual data/sample predictions are in their respective directories.

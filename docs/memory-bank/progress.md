# Progress: Crop Stress Detection Project

## What Works

*   Initial project structure for `22BCE10679_SumitVerma_CropStressDetection` is in place, aligning with submission requirements.
*   Core Python scripts (`train.py`, `predict.py`, `data_preprocessing.py`, `model_utils.py`) are present in `src/`.
*   `requirements.txt` is defined with necessary dependencies.
*   `docs/README.md` provides comprehensive setup and usage instructions.
*   The memory bank has been initialized and populated with:
    *   `projectbrief.md`
    *   `productContext.md`
    *   `activeContext.md`
    *   `systemPatterns.md`
    *   `techContext.md`

## What's Left to Build

*   **Data Availability:** Ensure actual image data is present in `data/images/` (or a sample with clear instructions for full dataset access).
*   **Model Training and Saving:** The user needs to run `train.py` to generate and save the trained model files (`crop_stress_model.h5`, `best_model.h5`) in the `models/` directory.
*   **Model Performance Verification:** Confirm that the trained model achieves >80% accuracy.
*   **Prediction Output:** The user needs to run `predict.py` to generate sample predictions and ensure they are saved in `output/sample_predictions/`.
*   **Project Report:** The `report.pdf` needs to be placed in the `docs/` directory.
*   **Final ZIP Packaging:** The final step will be to package the entire project into the specified ZIP file format.

## Current Status

The project is in the final preparation phase for submission. The foundational structure and documentation are in place, and the memory bank has been created. The remaining tasks involve running the core ML pipeline (training and prediction) and ensuring all required output files and the project report are present.

## Known Issues

*   None identified at this stage. Any issues will likely arise during the user's execution of the training and prediction scripts, which will need to be addressed.

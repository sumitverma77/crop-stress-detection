# Project Brief: Crop Stress Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect crop stress, specifically identifying nutrient deficiencies and drought conditions from images. The goal is to provide a robust solution for agricultural monitoring.

## Goals

*   Develop a machine learning model for crop stress detection.
*   Identify nutrient deficiencies and drought conditions from images.
*   Achieve a model performance of >80% accuracy (as clarified from mAP).
*   Provide clear instructions for project setup, training, and prediction.
*   Organize the project for easy submission in a ZIP file format.

## Requirements

*   The project uses Python and TensorFlow.
*   The model should be capable of image classification.
*   Dependencies are managed via `requirements.txt`.
*   Project structure must adhere to the specified submission format (src/, data/, models/, docs/, output/, requirements.txt, notebooks/).
*   A project report (`report.pdf`) is required.

## Scope

*   Focus on image-based classification for crop stress detection.
*   Provide a complete, runnable machine learning pipeline (data preprocessing, training, prediction).
*   Documentation for setup and usage.

## Out of Scope

*   Graphical user interface (GUI).
*   Real-time monitoring systems.
*   Advanced object detection for pinpointing affected areas (unless explicitly added as future work).
*   Deployment as a web service or mobile application.

## Success Criteria

*   The code runs without errors.
*   The model achieves >80% accuracy on the validation set.
*   The project ZIP file contains all required folders and files.
*   The `README.md` provides clear instructions for setup, training, and detection.

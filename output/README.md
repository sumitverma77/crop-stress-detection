# Output Directory

This directory is intended to store the outputs generated by the Crop Stress Detection project, such as sample predictions, evaluation metrics, and training logs.

**Contents:**

*   **`sample_predictions/`**: This subdirectory can contain example images with predictions overlaid or separate prediction results for visual inspection.
*   **`training_log.txt`**: A text file that can store the training history (loss, accuracy per epoch).
*   **`metrics.json`**: A JSON file to store key evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mAP if applicable).

**Usage:**

*   After running `src/train.py`, you might want to save the training history or evaluation results here.
*   After running `src/predict.py`, you can save the output images with predictions or a CSV file summarizing predictions here.

**Note:**
This directory will initially be empty. Files will be generated and saved here as you run the training and prediction scripts.
